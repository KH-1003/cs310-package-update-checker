CS 310 - W4 Package Update Checker

By Kaylee Hinton

## How did you get the list of packages?
    I updated the list of packages using apt update. Next I used apt
    --upgradable to list all the packages that can be upgraded and then
    wrote them to a text file.

## What is the crontab sequence to run the script?
    The sequence that initiates the cronjob to be ran is "0 0 * * 0" that way
    it is ran at midnight on every Sunday regardless of month or year.

## Since this script would require root, how do you install a crontab for root?
    While I used a python package for crontab and installed it into my local codespace, 
    the normal way you would install a crontab for root is using sudo crontab -e.
